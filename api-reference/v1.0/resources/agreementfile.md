# agreementFile resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Represents a customizable terms of use agreement file that a tenant manages with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). It contains metadata about the agreement file (for example, the name, the language, and whether it is the default file).

## Properties

|fileName|String|Name of the agreement file (for example, TOU.pdf). Read-only.|
|id|String|The identifier of the agreement file. Read-only.|
|isDefault|Boolean|If none of the languages matches the client preference, indicates that this is the default agreement file. If none of the files are marked as default, the first one is treated as the default. Read-only.|
|language|String|The language of the agreement file in the format languagecode2-country/regioncode2. languagecode2 is a lowercase two-letter code derived from ISO 639-1. country/regioncode2 is derived from ISO 3166 and usually consists of two uppercase letters, or a BCP-47 language tag (for example, en-US). Read-only.|
